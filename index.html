            The Ballad of the Sad Café is a novella by American author Carson
            McCullers, first published in 1951 by Houghton Mifflin as part of
            the author's short fiction collection The Ballad of the Sad Café and
            Other Stories.

         <p id="descr">
            The novella tells the story of a bizarre love triangle in a rural
            Georgia mill town, where a general store proprietress falls in love
            with a hunchbacked man — much to the ire of her convict ex-husband.

            Like much of McCullers's work, The Ballad of the Sad Café is a
            Gothic Southern tale of loneliness, social ostracization, and lives
            of quiet desperation. Miss Amelia is a towering woman, both in
            physical stature and in energy, though her size has made her both
            awkward and friendless. She devotes her life to her father, and when
            he passes away, she takes over his business running the town's
            general store.

         <p id="descr">
            Not long after her father dies, a handsome but troubled young man
            named Marvin Macy asks Miss Amelia to marry him, and she agrees, to
            the great confusion of the community. From all appearances, Marvin
            possesses true feelings for Miss Amelia. His previously vicious
            nature completely turns around, and he transforms into a gentle,
            seemingly good person. He truly settles down after walking down the
            aisle with Miss Amelia. But she has no intentions of being a typical
            wife, nor does she want a typical marriage. Miss Amelia is, after
            all, no typical woman in this small Southern town. She rejects her
            husband's affections, even after he gives up everything he owns to
            prove his love for her.
